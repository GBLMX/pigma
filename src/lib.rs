//! pigma library crate: the netease cloud music TUI and its CLI helpers.
//!
//! The modules are exposed so the binary entry point (`src/main.rs`) and the
//! CLI subcommands (`src/cli.rs`) can share the app logic without duplicating
//! it. `main.rs` keeps only process-level side effects (terminal init, argument
//! dispatch); everything else lives here.

/// Timing helper for the `#[ignore]`d benchmarks — see any `bench_*` test.
///
/// `cargo test --release --lib -- --ignored --nocapture` prints them. Criterion would be
/// a dependency tree for a handful of numbers, and the question here is narrow: does the
/// work that runs while music plays stay far below its own frame budget?
